```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```
This code compiles and runs without errors, but it is inefficient. The `sort` function has a time complexity of O(n log n), which is not necessary for this simple case.  A more efficient approach would be to use a linear-time sorting algorithm, such as insertion sort, if the input list is already almost sorted or known to be small.
